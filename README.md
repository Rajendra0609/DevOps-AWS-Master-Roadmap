# 🧱 DEVOPS + AWS MASTER ROADMAP

## Phase 1: Linux & Networking
- Linux administration (process, memory, disk)
- Networking (DNS, TCP/IP, NAT, firewall)
- SSH hardening & troubleshooting

**Real-time tasks**
- Jenkins server not starting → debug logs
- Application port blocked → fix firewall & routing
- Disk full → cleanup + monitoring

---

## Phase 2: Git & SCM
- Git internals (HEAD, index, objects)
- GitFlow & trunk-based development
- PR reviews & release tagging

**Hands-on**
- Create feature → PR → release → hotfix workflow

---

## Phase 3: CI/CD (Core DevOps)
- Pipeline as Code
- Multibranch pipelines
- Shared libraries
- Secrets management

**Hands-on**
- Jenkins pipeline with:
  - Build
  - Test
  - Security scan
  - Docker image push
  - Kubernetes deploy

---

## Phase 4: Build & Artifact Management
- Maven / Gradle
- Dependency caching
- Snapshot vs release

**Hands-on**
- Integrate Gradle with Artifactory
- Configure cleanup policies

---

## Phase 5: Containers & Kubernetes
- Docker internals
- Kubernetes architecture
- Pods, Services, Ingress
- HPA, probes, secrets

**Hands-on**
- Debug CrashLoopBackOff
- Implement rolling & blue-green deployment

---

## Phase 6: AWS (Deep Dive)
- EC2, ASG, ELB
- VPC, Subnets, NAT, IGW
- IAM roles & least privilege
- S3, RDS, CloudWatch
- EKS & Load Balancers

**Hands-on**
- Create VPC from scratch
- Deploy EKS cluster
- Zero-downtime app deployment

---

## Phase 7: Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform modules
- Remote backend
- Multi-environment setup

**Hands-on**
- Terraform AWS infra (dev/stage/prod)
- Drift detection & rollback

---

## Phase 8: Monitoring & Logging
- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- ELK logging
- Alertmanager

**Hands-on**
- Kubernetes + Jenkins monitoring
- Alerts for CPU, memory, pod restarts

---

## Phase 9: DevSecOps
- Shift-left security
- Image scanning
- Code quality

**Hands-on**
- Trivy image scan
- SonarQube quality gates
- Secrets scanning

---

## Phase 10: Production Skills
- Incident handling
- RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
- Cost optimization
- Disaster recovery

---
